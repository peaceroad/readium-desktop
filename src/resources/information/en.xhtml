    <h1>About Thorium Reader</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Thorium Reader is the Reading Application of choice for Windows 10, MacOS
      and Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <a href="https://edrlab.org">EDRLab</a> application is in constant
      development and aims at becoming a reference for accessing EPUB
      publications , PDF documents, audiobooks and visual narratives, LCP
      protected or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is localized in a large set of languages, each version offering new
      languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huge efforts are also made to get Thorium Reader highly accessible for
      visually impaired and dyslexic people.
    </p>
    <p>This application is free, with no ads and no leaks of private data.</p>
    <p>
      This is the perfect tools for heavy readers, library patrons and students.
    </p>

    <h2>Supported publication formats</h2>

    <p>
      EPUB 2: this is a legacy format, only adequate for basic ebooks. Textual
      content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is supported.
      EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      EPUB 3: this is the recommended format for the 21st century. Textual
      content is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create fixed-layout
      ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      PDF: despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option) and
      accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially in
      public libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      audiobooks: a
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/"
        >standardized format for audiobooks</a
      >
      has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab
      was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged (LPF)</a> audiobook format,
      which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      visual narratives: EDRLab has designed a standard format for comics,
      manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on sequances of
      images. <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the
      name of this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope
      that publishers will size it in 2021+.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>
      EDRLab has strong relationships with the
      <a href="https://daisy.org/">DAISY Consortium</a>, and we want to make
      Thorium Reader one on the most accessible reading application on the
      market; better than most commercial products.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is therefore fully adapted to screen readers like JAWS,
      NVDA or VoiceOver and is entirely usable from the keyboard. Keyboard
      shortcuts are configurable by the user to fit his personal preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>OPDS Catalogs</h2>

    <p>
      Many Public Libraries and booksellers are adopting
      <a href="https://opds.io/">OPDS</a> as a standard way to expose their
      catalogs on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using OPDS, libraries and booksellers can also expose the personal
      bookshelf of a patron or customer, i.e. the ebooks the user has acquired
      and can immediately download and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorium can browse OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs. It also supports several OPDS
      compliant authentication mechanisms, and can therefore allow users access
      to their personal bookshelf.
    </p>

    <h2>Readium LCP DRM</h2>

    <img src="./images/lcp-user.png" alt="LCP user reading" />

    <p>
      Thorium Reader supports the
      <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/">Readium LCP DRM</a>,
      originally designed by the Readium Foundation. The
      <a href="https://readium.org/lcp-specs/"
        >specification of this DRM is public</a
      >, and this is an ISO Technical Specification under the reference
      <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79485.html">ISO 23078-2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      LCP has already been adopted by many Public Libraries, Universities and
      booksellers around the world (<a
        href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/"
        >a list is maintained here</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations in the publishing sector, worldwide, are encouraged to adopt
      LCP as a way to protect ebooks against oversharing, while offering to
      users a frictionless experience and keeping content properly accessible.
      Please <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/contact/">contact EDRLab</a> if
      your organization is interested by adopting LCP.
